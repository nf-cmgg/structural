To make sure that you're running the latest version of the pipeline, make sure that you regularly update the cached version of the pipeline:</p> <pre><code>nextflow pull nf-cmgg/structural\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"usage/#reproducibility","title":"Reproducibility","text":"<p>It is a good idea to specify a pipeline version when running the pipeline on your data. This ensures that a specific version of the pipeline code and software are used when you run your pipeline. If you keep using the same tag, you'll be running the same version of the pipeline, even if there have been changes to the code since.</p> <p>First, go to the nf-cmgg/structural releases page and find the latest pipeline version - numeric only (eg. <code>1.3.1</code>). Then specify this when running the pipeline with <code>-r</code> (one hyphen) - eg. <code>-r 1.3.1</code>. Of course, you can switch to another version by changing the number after the <code>-r</code> flag.</p> <p>This version number will be logged in reports when you run the pipeline, so that you'll know what you used when you look back in the future. For example, at the bottom of the MultiQC reports.</p> <p>To further assist in reproducbility, you can use share and re-use parameter files to repeat pipeline runs with the same settings without having to write out a command with every single parameter.</p> <p>:::tip If you wish to share such profile (such as upload as supplementary material for academic publications), make sure to NOT include cluster specific paths to files, nor institutional specific profiles. :::</p>"},{"location":"usage/#core-nextflow-arguments","title":"Core Nextflow arguments","text":"<p>:::note These options are part of Nextflow and use a single hyphen (pipeline parameters use a double-hyphen). :::</p>"},{"location":"usage/#-profile","title":"<code>-profile</code>","text":"<p>Use this parameter to choose a configuration profile.
